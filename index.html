        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="date">Effective Date: February 17, 2026</p>
       
        <p>Umrah Guide ("we", "our", or "the app") is a mobile application developed by Ammar Yasir. This Privacy Policy exp
          lains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app.</p>
       
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
       
        <p><strong>Location Data</strong></p>
        <p>The app requests access to your device's location to provide the following features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Calculating the Qibla (prayer direction) from your current position</li>
            <li>Calculating accurate prayer times based on your geographic coordinates</li>
            <li>Displaying nearby holy sites on the map</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your location data is processed entirely on your device. We do not transmit, store, or share your location with a
          ny server or third party.</p>
       
        <p><strong>Analytics Data</strong></p>
        <p>We use Google Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous usage data such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Screen views and navigation patterns</li>
            <li>App launch and session duration</li>
           <li>Device type, operating system version, and country</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is aggregated and anonymous. It does not identify you personally and is used solely to understand how t
          he app is used and to improve the user experience.</p>
       
        <p><strong>Advertising Data</strong></p>
        <p>The app displays advertisements provided by Google AdMob. AdMob may collect device identifiers and usage data to
          serve ads. On iOS 14.5 and later, we request your permission via the App Tracking Transparency framework before any
          tracking occurs. You may decline tracking, and the app will continue to function normally with non-personalized ads.
          </p>
       
        <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not collect your name, email address, or any personal contact information</li>
            <li>We do not require account creation or login</li>
            <li>We do not access your contacts, photos, camera, or microphone</li>
            <li>We do not collect or store any health, financial, or sensitive personal data</li>
            <li>We do not sell any data to third parties</li>
        </ul>
       
        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The app integrates the following third-party services, each with their own privacy policies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> (advertising): <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Po
          licy</a></li>
            <li><strong>Google Firebase Analytics</strong> (analytics): <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy
          ">Firebase Privacy</a></li>
            <li><strong>Apple StoreKit</strong> (in-app purchases): Processed entirely by Apple under <a href="https://www.a
          pple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a></li>
        </ul>
       
        <h2>4. In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>The app offers a one-time, non-consumable in-app purchase to remove advertisements. This transaction is processed
           entirely by Apple (App Store) or Google (Play Store). We do not receive or store any payment information, credit ca
          rd details, or billing data.</p>
       
        <h2>5. Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All user preferences (such as dark mode setting, language choice, prayer calculation method, checklist items, and
           notification settings) are stored locally on your device using standard platform storage. This data is not transmit
          ted to any external server.</p>
       
        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The app is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from ch
          ildren. The app contains no objectionable content and is suitable for all ages.</p>
       
        <h2>7. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect personal data on our servers, there is no personal data to retain or delete. Uninstalling
           the app removes all locally stored preferences from your device. Anonymous analytics data retained by Firebase is s
          ubject to Google's data retention policies.</p>

          ures will be unavailable without location access.</li>
            <li>You can deny ad tracking via the App Tracking Transparency prompt on iOS, or through your device's privacy s

            <li>You can delete all local app data by uninstalling the app.</li>
        </ul>
